<p> my career objective is to become a skilled and knowledgeable cybersecurity professional,     
    focusing on protecting organizations from the growing threats of cyberattacks and data breaches. I plan to achieve this by continuing my education in cybersecurity, obtaining relevant certifications such as CompTIA Security+, Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), and Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP). In the short term, I aim to gain hands-on experience through internships and entry-level positions, where I can apply my knowledge of network security, ethical hacking, and risk management. In the long term, I hope to specialize in areas like penetration testing, incident response, or cybersecurity policy development. Ultimately, my goal is to work for a leading cybersecurity firm or organization, helping to safeguard critical infrastructure and data while staying ahead of emerging security threats.</p>

<p>Doing this activity was really cool because everything we’ve learned since starting this course all came together and became incredibly useful. From the basics of HTML to more advanced concepts like CSS styling and the importance of planning, each piece of knowledge played a role in helping me complete this project. The process of creating a Gantt chart allowed me to see firsthand how planning and time management can have a huge impact on the outcome of any project. It was a great opportunity to apply what we’ve been learning in a real-world context, where I had to manage tasks, set deadlines, and prioritize work.</p>
