Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language that focuses on the presentation of documents written in markup languages. It primarily facilitates the separation of content and presentation, allowing control over layout, colors, and fonts. CSS offers numerous benefits, including improved content accessibility, enhanced flexibility in specifying presentation characteristics, and the ability for multiple HTML pages to share common formatting. It reduces complexity and repetition in structural content and allows the same markup to be displayed in different styles based on rendering methods or screen sizes.

The CSS specification includes a priority scheme to determine which style rules apply when multiple rules match a particular element and is maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). A style sheet comprises rules, each containing selectors and a declaration block. Selectors indicate which markup elements the styles apply to by matching tags and attributes. Classes and IDs are case-sensitive and have specific usage: a class can be used on multiple elements, while an ID is unique to a single element.

A declaration block contains multiple declarations, each specifying a property and its corresponding value, separated by semicolons. CSS can be applied inline, internally, or externally, with inline CSS following a specific format.
