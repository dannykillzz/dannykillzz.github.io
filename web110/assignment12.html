JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language used alongside HTML and CSS to create interactive webpages and online applications, including video games. Despite some similarities with Java, such as syntax and naming, JavaScript is a distinct language with a different design. All modern web browsers support JavaScript, which is commonly used to add dynamic behavior to webpages, like loading new content without refreshing, animating elements, playing media, validating form inputs, and tracking user activities for analytics or personalization.

JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) of a webpage, allowing scripts to change content or styles dynamically. However, because JavaScript can run on a user's computer, it poses security risks. To mitigate these, browsers run scripts in a "sandbox" environment, limiting their actions to web-related tasks, and enforcing the same-origin policy to prevent unauthorized access to data across different websites.

While JavaScript is essential for client-side interactions, it has limitations. It is not secure for sensitive tasks, as the source code is visible to users, and relying on JavaScript for security measures like form validation or image protection is discouraged. Developers need to be cautious about embedding sensitive data in JavaScript since it can be exploited by attackers.

JavaScript is case-sensitive and typically follows a camelCase naming convention. It allows variables to hold any type of value without a fixed data type. JavaScript also supports debugging tools built into major browsers and environments like Node.js. The <canvas> element in HTML5 enables scriptable rendering of 2D graphics and images.
