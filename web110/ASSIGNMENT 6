Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a technology that allows voice communication and multimedia sessions to happen over the Internet instead of traditional phone lines. This includes services like making calls, sending text messages, and faxing through the public Internet. VoIP works by breaking voice data into small packets and sending them over a packet-switched network, which is more efficient than older circuit-switched networks. It can be used on various devices, including dedicated phones, smartphones, and computers, and works over mobile networks or Wi-Fi.

File transfer is the process of sending files from one computer to another through a network. There are different ways to transfer files, including using protocols like File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which operates on a client-server model. Users can log in with a username and password or connect anonymously if permitted. For added security, file transfers can use encryption methods like SSL/TLS. There’s also SFTP, which offers secure file transfers but works differently from FTP.

Peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing allows users to share digital media like music and movies directly between their computers without needing a central server. P2P networks consist of users' computers that connect to each other. While sharing files is generally legal, it can raise legal issues if copyrighted material is involved.

Remote desktop software enables users to access and control a computer from another device. This allows someone to see and interact with their computer’s desktop remotely, capturing keyboard and mouse inputs from the local device and sending them to the remote computer. This technology is useful for troubleshooting or accessing files from different locations.
