Internet security is a vital branch of computer security that addresses the vulnerabilities associated with online interactions. Its primary goal is to protect information exchanged over the Internet from various threats, including phishing, malware, and denial-of-service attacks. 

Malware, which encompasses a range of malicious software like viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, and ransomware, is specifically designed to disrupt computer operations or extract sensitive information without the user's consent. Botnets represent a significant threat as they consist of networks of infected computers controlled remotely to carry out large-scale attacks. Scareware, on the other hand, uses deceptive marketing tactics to instill fear in users, prompting them to purchase unnecessary software.

Phishing is a common tactic where attackers masquerade as trustworthy entities to steal personal information. To combat these threats, various security measures are employed, such as encryption protocols (like SSL and TLS), multi-factor authentication, firewalls, and antivirus programs, which collectively work to safeguard digital environments.

Furthermore, ethical codes are often implemented within organizations to guide decision-making, helping members differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable behaviors in the realm of Internet security. This holistic approach is essential in fostering a secure online experience and protecting users from malicious activities.
