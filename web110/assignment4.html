Email is a way to send messages electronically between people. Modern email systems work on a store-and-forward model, where email servers handle the sending, receiving, and storing of messages. When you send an email, your program, known as a mail user agent (MUA), sends the message to your outgoing mail server using a protocol called SMTP. The server then identifies the destination mail server by looking up the domain name in the DNS system. Once the message reaches the recipient's server, it gets stored in their mailbox.

Recipients can access their emails using either the Post Office Protocol (POP) or the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP). POP often deletes messages from the server after downloading, while IMAP allows users to manage their emails from multiple devices and keeps messages on the server. Email messages include headers that provide information like the sender, recipient, and subject.

Most people today use web-based email services rather than running their own email programs. Some email messages can also include attachments and different formats, thanks to technologies like MIME, which supports various character sets and multimedia content. Additionally, electronic mailing lists enable the distribution of messages to many subscribers. These lists can be automated, allowing messages to be sent out to all members when someone writes to the list's email address. The mailing list software decides how to handle incoming messages, either forwarding them immediately or compiling them into a daily summary for subscribers. Overall, email is a versatile and widely used tool for communication in our digital world.
