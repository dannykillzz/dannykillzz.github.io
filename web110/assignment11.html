Computer graphics are pictures and films created using computers. Computer graphic development has significantly impacted many types of media, revolutionizing animation, movies, advertising, video games, and graphic design generally. Computer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers. 

A raster graphics or bitmap image is a dot matrix data structure representing a generally rectangular grid of pixels or points of color, viewable via a monitor, paper, or other display medium. Raster graphics are resolution dependent, meaning they cannot scale up to an arbitrary resolution without loss of apparent quality. In contrast, vector graphics use polygons to represent images in computer graphics. Vector art is ideal for printing since it is made from a series of mathematical curves, allowing it to print very crisply even when resized.

Raster-based image editors, such as Painter, Photoshop, Paint.NET, MS Paint, and GIMP, revolve around editing pixels. Vector-based image editors, such as Xfig, CorelDRAW, Adobe Illustrator, or Inkscape, focus on editing lines and shapes (vectors). The `<img>` element is used to insert an image into an HTML page, with the `src` attribute specifying the image URL. The required `alt` attribute provides alternative text in case the image cannot be displayed.

Multimedia is content that uses a combination of different content forms such as text, audio, images, animations, video, and interactive content. Multimedia can be recorded and played, displayed, interacted with, or accessed by information content processing devices, such as computerized and electronic devices. The term "rich media" is synonymous with interactive multimedia. Digital online multimedia may be downloaded or streamed, with streaming multimedia being either live or on-demand. Enhanced levels of interactivity are possible by combining multiple forms of media content. Online multimedia is increasingly becoming object-oriented and data-driven, enabling applications with collaborative end-user innovation and personalization over time. 

In addition to seeing and hearing, haptic technology enables virtual objects to be felt. Emerging technology involving illusions of taste and smell may also enhance the multimedia experience. Multimedia may be broadly divided into linear and non-linear categories: linear active content progresses often without any navigational control for the viewer, such as in a cinema presentation, while non-linear uses interactivity to control progress, as seen in video games or self-paced computer-based training. Hypermedia is an example of non-linear content.

Multimedia presentations can be live or recorded. A recorded presentation may allow interactivity via a navigation system, while a live multimedia presentation may enable interactivity through interaction with the presenter or performer. Multimedia finds applications in various areas, including but not limited to advertisements, art, education, entertainment, engineering, medicine, mathematics, business, scientific research, and spatial-temporal applications.

Streaming media is multimedia that is constantly received by and presented to an end user while being delivered by a provider. A client end user can use their media player to begin to play the data file (such as a digital file of a movie or song) before the entire file has been transmitted. Live streaming refers to Internet content delivered in real-time as events happen. There are challenges with streaming content on the Internet; if the user does not have enough bandwidth in their Internet connection, they may experience interruptions, and some users may not be able to stream certain content due to incompatible computer or software systems. The `<audio>` element represents a sound or an audio stream.
