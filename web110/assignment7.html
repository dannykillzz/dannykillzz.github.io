A computer network is a digital telecommunications system that enables data exchange between computers using packets transmitted over wired or wireless connections. Wired media includes coaxial, twisted-pair cables, and optical fiber, while wireless connections often use Wi-Fi, defined by the IEEE 802.11 standard. A network interface controller (NIC) allows access to the network, featuring a unique 48-bit MAC address in Ethernet networks.

Devices like repeaters, hubs, and switches facilitate signal transmission and data filtering between network segments. Routers forward packets between different networks based on IP addresses, while modems connect networks using analog signals over physical wires. Firewalls enhance security by managing access based on predefined rules.

Network topology describes the layout of interconnected nodes, with common structures including bus, star, ring, and mesh. Protocols, such as the protocol stack of HTTP over TCP over IP over IEEE 802.11, govern data exchange over networks. The Internet protocol suite, maintained by the IETF, consists of four layers: Link, Internet, Transport, and Application, each serving distinct roles in communication.

The Domain Name System (DNS) translates user-friendly domain names into IP addresses, facilitating resource identification on the Internet. It operates hierarchically, allowing network administrators to delegate domain authority and manage sub-domains. The domain name space is organized as a tree structure, with the right-most label indicating the top-level domain.
