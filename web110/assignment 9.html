Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and applications, allowing web browsers to retrieve and render documents into multimedia formats. HTML defines the semantic structure of a web page, initially incorporating presentation cues, and consists of elements that serve as the building blocks of pages. These elements are represented by tags written in angle brackets, which browsers use to interpret content but do not display.

HTML enables the embedding of images, interactive forms, and scripts, such as JavaScript, to enhance functionality. The inclusion of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) defines the visual appearance and layout of the content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has advocated for using CSS for styling over direct presentational HTML since 1997. The current standard, HTML5, was finalized on October 28, 2014.

HTML markup includes tags and attributes, character references, and entity references. Tags often come in pairs, with a start tag and an end tag, though some are self-closing. The general format of an HTML element follows the structure of `<tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">content</tag>`, and default values apply when attributes are not specified. A typical HTML document incorporates these essential components.
