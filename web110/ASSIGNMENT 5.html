Social media refers to online tools that help people create and share information, ideas, and personal expressions through virtual communities. Key features include interactivity, user-generated content, and the ability to connect with others. Popular platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit, Snapchat, Tumblr, Twitter, and YouTube each have their unique functions. For example, Facebook allows users to create profiles and exchange messages, while Instagram focuses on sharing photos and videos.

These platforms have changed how people and organizations communicate, making interactions more dynamic than traditional media. Social media also offers opportunities for content creators to build reputations and earn money. However, there are concerns about the negative effects of heavy use, such as depression, cyberbullying, and online harassment.

Social media operates differently from traditional media by allowing two-way communication rather than one-way broadcasts. Users interact through various aspects like personal identity, conversation, sharing, and building relationships. This interaction is framed by whatâ€™s called the "honeycomb framework." Additionally, automated bots can mimic human behavior, making it hard to tell who is real and who is a bot. Privacy concerns also arise as these platforms often collect personal data, prompting users to be careful about their online presence. Overall, social media connects people but also poses challenges.
